# customer-churn-analysis
Analyzed customer behavior and subscription data to identify key drivers of churn. Used SQL for data extraction, for exploratory analysis, and visualized insights using Power BI. Key findings helped segment at-risk customers based on tenure, usage patterns, and support interactions. The project aimed to support retention strategies and improve customer lifetime value.
